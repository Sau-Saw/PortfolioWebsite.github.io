									<h1>ABOUT ME BEYOND THE RESUME</h1>

								<!-- Text stuff -->
									<h2>Hello / Bonjour/ Howdy / Namaste!</h2>
									<p>Thanks for stopping by. I’m really glad you’re here. 
									<p>I wanted to create an about me on my website to give you insights on me beyond 
										my resume which is on the next tab by the way. Much like Julie Andrews sings in 
										The Sound of Music “Let’s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start…” </p>
									<p>I was born and raised in Mumbai, India. I’ve always been a curious and energetic person. 
	My teachers called me outgoing, talkative, and a bit mischievous (they weren’t wrong). 
										Growing up, I was active in school plays (my dad has had a life long passion for theater 
										acting and directing) and sports, especially cricket. Like most Indians, I’ve been obsessed 
										with the game since childhood and I still can’t turn off the TV if a match is on, no matter who’s playing.</p>
									<p>Cricket is a complex sport with endless layers, stats, and strategies and I think that’s where I first fell in 
										love with data. I was fascinated by the analysis behind every play and decision. Over time, that interest evolved 
										into a deeper passion for working with data to find patterns, insights, and stories.</p>
									<p>Despite coming from a family rooted in commerce with a lot of successful people to look up to, I surprised my parents 
										by choosing to study science. Eventually I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology from Mumbai University.</p>
									<p>With my continued passion to work in Data science after graduation, I realized I would need an advanced degree. I have family spread 
										across various parts of Asia and Europe, and moving to one of those regions for my masters would have been a more familiar and 
										comfortable path. But I wanted to challenge myself. I chose the U.S. not just because I was accepted into one of the best program at 
										the University of Texas at Dallas with a Dean’s Excellence Scholarship, but also because I felt a deep need to prove that I could 
										build something entirely on my own, in a place where I had no family, no network, and no safety net. That decision, though daunting, 
										felt like the right step toward personal and professional growth and I believe has a huge contribution to making me the person I am today.</p>
									<p>After graduating with Master of Science in Information Technology and Management with a concentration in Business Intelligence and Analytics, 
										I started working remotely for Parker University in Dallas before remote work was the norm (That’s an entire story by itself).That flexibility 
										gave me the opportunity to travel extensively over the years.</p>		
									<p>In 2024, after eight years in Dallas, I decided to make a big move again this time to Toronto, Canada. I was lucky to be given the opportunity to 
										be a Permanent Resident of Canada and I’m excited to build a life and career here long term. While I’m still working remotely for my U.S. employer, 
										I’m actively looking to transition into a role in Canada where I can contribute locally, grow professionally, and make a meaningful impact with my skills.</p>
If you’re still reading this, thanks for making it to the end. I’d love to connect and have a conversation!</p>
